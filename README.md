# Local Vendor Live Shopping & Bargaining Platform

## Overview

This project is a platform where local vendors can showcase their products in a *live chat room. Customers can join these rooms, explore different vendors, and interact with them through messages. If they want, they can initiate a **video call* to check the product in real-time before making a purchase. The goal is to bring the *local market experience online* with the added convenience of digital payments and potential delivery options.
